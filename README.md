# Sales Insights Dashbord

### Learnings: 
Through this project, I gained valuable skills in several areas, including:
- working with the AIMS grid
- performing ETL operations
- cleaning and normalizing data
- using DAX language to create custom visualizations.
I also learned about how data analysis projects are executed in big companies, which was an eye-opening experience.

### AIMS Grid:
It is a project management tool. It has four interdependent components-
1. Purpose
2. Stake Holder(People Involved)
3. End result
4. Success criteria

The final product is an interactive dashboard that effectively displays the sales trend , allowing users to easily understand the data and make informed, data-driven decisions. I'm confident that this dashboard has the potential to increase the company's sales and revenue in the next quarter.
